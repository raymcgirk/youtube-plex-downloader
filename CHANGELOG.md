# Changelog

## v1.3.2 - Hotfix for New Channel Detection (March 12, 2025)
### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where newly enabled channels were not being detected properly and did not fetch videos.
- The script now correctly updates video_cache.json when a new channel is added, ensuring new videos are downloaded without affecting existing cached data.
- Improved logging clarity for new channel fetching to ensure correct debugging and monitoring.
### Notes
- This is a hotfix to address a bug introduced in v1.3.1. No new features have been added.
- The script now functions as expected when enabling additional channels and dynamically pulls new content.

## v1.3.1 - Bug Fixes & Optimizations (March 12, 2025)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where only one channel was downloading due to caching not updating correctly.
- Resolved a bug where video_cache.json incorrectly stored _latest entries, causing crashes when iterating over channels.
- Prevented the script from attempting to download thumbnails every time it runs by checking if folder.jpg already exists in the Plex directory.
- Fixed logging order so that the script correctly logs when it is checking for a thumbnail before attempting a download.
- Corrected an issue where the script was using the channel URL name (streetscaping) instead of the actual channel name (Streetscapes) for organizing files.
- Fixed a bug where yt-dlp was hanging when attempting to extract the uploader name from the channel page; now correctly extracts it from the latest video.
### Optimizations
- Improved cache handling to ensure that new videos are fetched without re-caching everything.
- Optimized the thumbnail download process to prevent redundant operations.
- Adjusted the script to handle errors more gracefully when yt-dlp encounters unexpected issues.
- Ensured that logging is now clear, sequential, and informative.
### Notes
- Future feature requests (e.g., limiting downloads to the last X videos or videos after a certain date) would be considered for a future minor release.
